# For local development, we expose both 80 and 443 -- we always run on https against the ui and services.

# DNS is set to google for now; leaving it alone causes it to use the host for DNS resolution, which
# has the unfortunate side effect of propagating the /etc/hosts entries as well, which messes
# up the proxying of kbase services.
#
# We mount the configuration directory in, but we could copy it. For modeling the flexibility of deployment
# reconfig, though, it should be mounted from the host environment. The configuration directory
# location is provided as arg1. This directory is mounted as /conf in the docker container.
#
# The second argument is the deployment environment - dev, ci, next, appdev, prod - which corresponds
# to the config file within that location.
#
# Then we mount whichever directories we want to be working on.
#
# TODO: this should be driven either by command line options or simply add a config section in here to
# allow declaring which plugins or bits of the ui source to mount inside.
# we use the :dev image
# we specify the configuration target as the first environment (dev, ci, next, appdev, prod). This lets
# lets us easily swap out the targeted environment without rebuilding or anything.
# NOTE: Just because the config is swapped to a different environment doesn't mean the build reflects it.
# There is a separate build for dev, ci and prod, which expose different bits of the ui. Because this
# impacts the dependencies loaded and integrated, it is not something that can be configured here.
# Well, it COULD be, I supose...
