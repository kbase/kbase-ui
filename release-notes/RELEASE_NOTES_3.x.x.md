# KBase kbase-ui 3.x.x Release Notes

This would have been the 3.x.x release, but another ui team has started a parallel effort to reproduce kbase-ui, but with a fresh start and different concepts of app design, preferences for frameworks and libraries.

Heck, why not give the new kids on the block the chance to have some fun?

For this effort, everything has been rewritten, although since the previous incarnation of kbase-ui has long been rewritten in preact, much of that quasi-jsx (preact + htm)was simply copy-pasted with light modification.
