Welcome to the Narrative Interface!
===

What's a Narrative?
---

Design and carry out collaborative computational experiments while
creating Narratives: interactive, shareable, and reproducible records
of your data, computational steps, and thought processes.

Get Some Data
---

Click the Add Data button in the Data Panel to browse for KBase data or
upload your own. Mouse over a data object to add it to your Narrative, and
check out more details once the data appears in your list.

Analyze It
---

Browse available analyses that can be run using KBase apps or methods
(apps are just multi-step methods that make some common analyses more
convenient). Select an analysis, fill in the fields, and click Run.
Output will be generated, and new data objects will be created and added
to your data list. Add to your results by running follow-on apps or methods.

Save and Share Your Narrative
---

Be sure to save your Narrative frequently. When you're ready, click
the share button above to let collaborators view your analysis steps
and results. Or better yet, make your Narrative public and help expand
the social web that KBase is building to make systems biology research
open, collaborative, and more effective.
