# Editing an Existing File

All documents which appear in the site are located in the top level repo directory. They are arranged in a directory structure which is the same as the table of contents in the documentation site. Each visible page is a markdown file.

To update a page, simply update the associated markdown file. 

If you have the developer server running (as described above), you should see your changes appear on the associated page within a few seconds.
