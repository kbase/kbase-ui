# Makefile for kbase-ui.
#
# The general flow is as follows:
# 1. Local development = just run 'make'
# 2. KBase deployment = run 'make && make deploy'
# (this might take a little configuration depending on the
# deployment location)
# 3. Run all tests = make test
#
# This Makefile is mostly here as a convenience to the devops
# crew. The actual build/test/deploy process is managed by
# Grunt (in a common JavaScript style), but some essential tasks
# are exposed here.

# set TARGET to use different deploy-*.cfg files (deploy-ci, deploy-prod, etc)
# currently only 'prod', 'ci', and 'next' are valid variables.
