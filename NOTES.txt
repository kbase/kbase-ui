LEft off here ...
trying to get the developer workflow w/in a container working.
if the modules/plugins is populated before starting, the volume mount doesn't overwrite the internal one
if the internal one is removed, I can see the volume mounted one, but loading plugins goes into an infinite loop.

I'm thinking of doing a probe for the plugin's presence before mounting.


Okay, local developer workflow is working fine now.

Now ... work on the config..

config now lives in /kb/deployment/deploy/config

All deploy artifacts which can be overridden should be placed in "deploy". 
This facilitates local development, and presumably deployment as well.

extract git info for each plugin 
place in plugins.json
note that this should be simulated in the local proxy plugins - 
which means that the plugin gitinfo should be created during the plugin install
process and left as a manifest in the plugin directory.

main config is created by dockerize and the gitlab config

build info for kbase-ui itself will be placed into deploy/build.json
