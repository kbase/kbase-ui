# KBase UI Development Docs

> Documentation for kbase-ui development

## Usage

This documentation is designed to be accessed at its home on Github, located at [https://kbase.github.io/kbase-ui](https://kbase.github.io/kbase-ui).

For developers, see [the developer documentation](https://kbase.github.io/kbase-ui/documentation)

## Installation

This documentation is based on the standalone version of gitbook. A such, it is based on Jekyll, a website generation tool written in Ruby.

The instructions below describe how to set up a macOS

### MacOS

#### Native

macOS ships with Ruby. However, since it is at the system level it may require root access to install gems. It should prompt you for your password (assuming you have admin access), but that doesn't always work. A good solution is documented [https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#sudo-less-installation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#sudo-less-installation)

To cut to the chase:

```bash
export GEM_HOME=$HOME/.gem
export PATH=$GEM_HOME/bin:$PATH
```

#### With `rbenv`

`rbenv` is a simple tool that allows you to install multiple versions of Ruby, with associated dependencies. It offers some advantages over the system Ruby:

- We can use a specific version of Ruby
- Ruby dependencies (Gems) are installed separate from the system
- Admin privileges not required

Using `macports`:

```zsh
sudo port install rbenv ruby-build
```

Using `home brew`:

```zsh
brew install rbenv ruby-build
```

Set up rbenv:

> See: [https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

```zsh
rbenv init
```

instructions will be printed for completing the rbenv integration. This is optional, and simply means that in future terminal sessions you don't need to enter a command to enable rbenv within the terminal session.

E.g., in macOS Catalina:

```zsh
# Load rbenv automatically by appending
# the following to ~/.zshrc:

eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

If you don't want rbenv to be set up in your shell init script, you can simply enter at the terminal:

```zsh
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
```

Note that this will only be effective for this specific Terminal session.

Check your setup:

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
```

Install a version of ruby:

```zsh
rbenv install 2.7.0
```

If you want to use this ruby version permanently,

```zsh
rbenv global 2.7.0
```

for this project

```zsh
rbenv local 2.7.0
```

for the shell session only

```zsh
rbenv local 2.7.0
```

Although `bundler` may be installed with Ruby with rbenv, it is best to just install it from scratch to get the most recent version (at present we need version 2).

```zsh
gem install bundler
```

#### With `rvm`

Another tool for installing and managing multiple Rubys is `rvm`. Some consider it more complex than it needs to be, and it is more intrusive into your shell startup scripts, but it is simple to use.

Install `rvm` from [https://rvm.io](https://rvm.io).

##### Install rvm

This will install `rvm` into your own home directory.

```zsh
gpg2 --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

###### Install ruby

```zsh
rvm install 2.7.0
```

This will take a while. It is possible that you'll need to install macOS developer tools like XCode, macports, or homebrew. I use macports, and the install does conduct a macports update.

Open a terminal into this repo's top level directory

- install `bundler` version 2 if you don't already have it (it is a Ruby package.)

  If you installed Ruby with rvm, bundler 1 will already been installed. It will be need to be updated:

    ```bash
    gem install bundler
    ```

    > Note that this and other Ruby related commands will probably ask you to authorize installation. This is because the packages (gems) are being installed at the system level. Just go ahead and authorize - do not try to run these commands with `sudo`, as they are designed to be run as a regular user and only prompt for authorization when they need to.

### Local Development Server

Now you are ready to start up a local copy of the documentation site. This is accomplish by running a built-in server provided by Jekyll.

- open a terminal in this repo

- you'll be working within the root directory (not docs as is sometimes the case)

- install dependencies required by github pages:

    ``` bash
    bundle install
    ```

- start the Jekyll server

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
    ```

- take your browser to [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000).

- You should see the `kbase-ui-docs` site in full glory.

- As you edit and save source files, the documentation site will be rebuilt, and the browser will reload.

### Common Editing Tasks

#### Editing an Existing File

All documents which appear in the site are located in the `docs` directory. They are arranged in a directory structure which is the same as the table of contents in the documentation site. Each visible page is a markdown file.

To update a page, simply update the associated markdown file.

If you have the developer server running (as described above), you should see your changes appear on the associated page within a few seconds.

#### Changing a menu item

The menu is stored in the standard Jekyll yaml configuration file `_config.yml` located in the `docs` directory.

The `navigation` section contains a single item `menu`, which itself represents the entire navigation menu as a hierarchy as it appears on the site itself.

Each menu item requires the `label` property. The label serves as the menu label, a navigation element in the url, and also either a directory entry or the documentation file to display.

To change a menu's label, simply edit the associated label in this file.

Autoloading does not work for changes to the config file, nor does manual reloading of the page - so you'll need to stop and start the development server.

#### Adding a new file

1. Determine where in the directory hierarchy the file should reside.
   - The top of the repo is the top of the hierarchy.

2. Update `_config.yml` to add the file to the menu.
   - Each menu entry is an object in a list of other menu entries
   - The only required property is `label`, which serves as the menu display label
   - It is best to only use the label property. it will be converted to a file name by:
      1. lowercasing
      2. replacing spaces with `-`

3. Add the file to the appropriate location with a name corresponding to the menu label, as described above.

4. The file should have the following structure:

    ```markdown
    ---
    ---
    # TITLE
    ```

5. Start or stop and restart the Jekyll server:

   ```bash
   bundler exec jekyll serve --livereload
   ```

6. Confirm that the page is working correctly from the menu

7. Now you may edit the new file

### Current Issues

#### search broken

If you see messages like `ERROR '/search-data.json' not found.` in the terminal in which you started `jekyll serve`, the search index needs to be built. Unfortunately, our theme's support for search is broken in several respects, and generating the search index will not help. Since search is not exposed, it is currently a harmless error.

#### readme needs completion

> TODO :)

#### `livereload` and node_modules

The `--livereload` option to `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload` causes jekyll to watch the filesystem for changes, and when such occurs to rebuild the files and trigger a reload in the browser.

Since this is a branch of the repo, if you have worked with kbase-ui develop branch, you'll probably have generated ignored artifacts. When switching docker branches, these artifacts will remain in the filesystem, and the `livereload` feature will dig into node_modules and other artifact directories. For most directories, this is harmless, but for `node_modules`, an error will be triggered (and performance may suffer due to the large number of files to watch.)

The `livereload` option has a sister option `livereload_ignore` which is actually present in the `_config.yml` file, and specifies to ignore `node_modules`. Unfortunately, this option affects only what jekyll does when changed files are reported -- the file watcher still watches all files in the entire repo.

The only solution at this time is to remove the `node_modules` directory when working on the `gh-pages` branch, and restore it via `yarn install` when switching back to work on the `develop` branch.

### The theme

The document look, feel, and operation is determined by the Jekyll theme used. In this case, it is our own theme (based on another) [KBase Github Pages Theme](https://github.com/kbase/kbase-github-pages-theme).

## Background

This documentation set should provide instructions for building and deploying kbase-ui, and also background information on it's design and operation.
