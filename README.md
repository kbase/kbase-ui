## About

The KBase User Interface (*kbase-ui*) is a web browser Single Page App (SPA) providing tools for [KBase](http://kbase.us) users. It is a partner to the [KBase Narrative Interface](https://github.com/kbase/narrative), with which it shares code yet runs as a separate web app. Current user features include:

- *Dashboard*, for an overview of a user's narratives and activities, and those of their colleagues
- *User Profile*, for viewing any user profile and editing their own, 
- *Data Viewer*, for inspecting any data object a user has access to (aka "landing pages"),
- *Type Viewer*, for inspecting the attributes of any data type,
- *Authenticator*, for logging into and out of user's KBase Account and granting authorization to the web app,
- *Catalog*, for browsing, searching and (for developers) managing KBase Narrative Apps.

> If you have stumbled up on this project, you may first want to [find out about KBase](http://kbase.us). 
> The *KBase UI* is not a general purpose tool -- it is designed to work inside the KBase ecosystem. 

The primary audience for this project is 

- *KBase Developers and Staff* - who need access to the kbase-ui for development, testing, deployment
- *KBase ContributorsAdvanced Users* - who are developing servivces and plugins for kbase-ui,
- *KBase Contributors* - who wish to know more about the architecture and "sausage making" of KBase.
