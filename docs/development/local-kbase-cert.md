# Local KBase Server Certs

## Background

When developing kbase-ui, the recommended workflow requires that the developer operate the kbase-ui web app at a normal kbase host. The workflow supported over the last year or so involves the usage of a self-signed certificate inside the development proxy.

This works for the development process, but introduces a few issues:

1. Browsers require extra steps in order to operate against servers with self signed certificates.

2. All browsers work best in private or incognito mode with self signed certificates

3. Some browser plugins, including some development tools like google tag assistant, do not work in private or incognito mode.

## Solution

There is a solution to this issue, which allows the use of locally generated certificates, granted against the appropriate hosts, which do not generate browser errors - they are recognized as valid certificates.

This allows using a browser in its normal mode, with full plugin support.

## Instructions

The solution hinges on a utility named `mkcert`: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert

`mkcert` works by installing its own certificate authority (CS) into the local system and browser (Firefox, Chrome) trust stores and generating a certificate and key which will be subsequently trusted, and avoid browser (and test tool) workarounds required by using a self signed cert.

While the prospect of installing a "fake" trusted certificate on your local machine may seem scary, the tool is widely used and completely reversible.

Instructions for installing it can be found at the repo cited above.

### install with macports

For example, if you are a macOS user utilizing macports:

```shell
sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install mkcert
sudo port install nss
```

After installing mkcert, the kbase-ui Makefile provides support.

> If you use *brew* there are surely similar packages

### set up mkcert

Before using the mkcert-generated certs, you need to install the host-wide root cert:

```shell
mkcert -install
```

### generate cert files

Use the kbase-ui make task to generate server cert files and place them in the correct location. That location is within the development proxy ssl directory (`tools/proxy/contents/ssl`).

```shell
make dev-cert
```

After this the certs will be in the proper location for the local proxy, and it can be run as normal.

### remove mkcert

```shell
mkcert -uninstall
make remove-dev-cert
```

## Enabling self signed certs

If you do not install the dev cert through the process described above, a self signed certificate will be generated when the proxy is launched.

> NB: accessing http servers using self signed certs is no longer a viable development technique due to increased security requirements for browsers
