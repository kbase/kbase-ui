# Create from Scratch

This document walks through the process, from scratch, of creating a `kbase-ui` plugin in the *new* front end stack and kbase-ui integration techniques.

If one needs to convert an existing web app to act as a kbase-ui plugin, I belive that skipping to section 6 should suffice.

> Note, as well, dear reader, that this was originally written as a primer for a coworker with no Typescript, and modest Javascript experience. Thus it walks through the process from start to finish, and I had hoped she could provide feedback, corrections, suggestions. However, she was redirected to other work. At this point, I don't remember whether she used this document or if she asked me to convert her app to a plugin, but in any case I never did receive feedback or validation that the instructions were correct and clear.
