# Docker Compose Override

This script prepares a `docker-compose-override.yml` file which works in conjunction with a base `dev/docker-compose.yml` file to augment its behavior.

This docker compose configuration is used in development for various scenarios, such as using a set of configuration files (simulating the set of config files in gitlab), proxying to local services, dynamic services, narrative and navigator.
